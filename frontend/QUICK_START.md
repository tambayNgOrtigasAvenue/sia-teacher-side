3. `frontend/src/components/common/dashboard/my-classes/icons.jsx` - Icon library
4. `frontend/CLASS_MANAGEMENT_README.md` - Full documentation

### Updated Files:
1. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Routes to ClassManagementApp
2. `frontend/src/components/pages/myClassesPage.jsx` - Now accepts props
3. `frontend/src/components/common/dashboard/my-classes/viewMyClasses.jsx` - Dynamic navigation
4. `frontend/src/components/common/dashboard/my-classes/searchBarWithFilter.jsx` - Uses icon library
5. `frontend/src/components/common/dashboard/my-classes/headerPage.jsx` - Improved docs

## How to Test Right Now

### 1. Navigate to My Classes
- Go to: `http://localhost:5173/teacher-dashboard/my-classes`
- You should see the class list

### 2. Test Navigation
- Click "View Class Details" on any **active** class (not pending ones)
- You'll be taken to the student details page
- Click the back button (← Grade Levels & Sections)
- You'll return to the class list

### 3. Test Search & Filter on Class List
- Type "Grade 6" in search → Shows only Grade 6 classes
- Select "Favorited" filter → Shows only starred classes
- Select "Pending" filter → Shows only pending class
- Select "All Classes" → Shows everything
- Try combining search + filter

### 4. Test Search & Filter on Student List
- Navigate to any class details
- Type "Jan" in search → Shows students with "Jan" in their name
- Select "Present" filter → Shows only present students
- Select "Absent" filter → Shows only absent student (Legaspina)
- Try combining search + filter

## Understanding the Navigation

### The Flow:
```
My Classes Page (List View)
    ↓ [Click "View Class Details"]
Student Details Page (Shows selected class data)
    ↓ [Click "← Back"]
My Classes Page (Back to list)
```

### How It Works:
- **ClassManagementApp** holds the state
- When you click a class, it stores that class data
- It then shows the details page with that data
- Clicking back clears the stored data and shows the list again

## Mock Data Included

### Classes (7 total):
- Grade 6, Section A (Favorited, Active)
- Grade 6, Section B (Favorited, Pending)
- Grade 2, Section C (Active)
- Grade 3, Section B (Active)
- Grade 5, Section A (Active)
- Grade 4, Section C (Active)
- Grade 1, Section A (Active)

### Students (9 total):
- 8 Present students
- 1 Absent student (Legaspina, Nathelee)

## Next Steps to Connect to Database

### Option 1: Keep it standalone
Just use it as is! It works perfectly with mock data.

### Option 2: Connect to API
See the "Converting to API Data" section in `CLASS_MANAGEMENT_README.md`

Basic steps:
1. Create API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/classes/get-teacher-classes.php`
   - `GET /api/students/get-by-class.php?classId=X`

2. Replace mock data with `useEffect` + `fetch` calls

3. That's it! Everything else works the same.

## Key Features You Can Use Right Now

### ✅ Working Features:
1. **Navigation** - Click buttons to switch between pages
2. **Search** - Type to filter lists in real-time
3. **Filters** - Dropdown filtering by status/attendance
4. **Favorited** - Star icons show on favorited classes
5. **Status badges** - "Pending" badges, attendance lozenges
6. **Responsive** - Works on mobile, tablet, desktop

## Customization Tips

### Change Colors:
Look for these Tailwind classes:
- `bg-amber-300` → Header background
- `bg-amber-400` → Button background
- `text-orange-600` → Subtitle color

### Add More Filters:
Edit `searchBarWithFilter.jsx`:
```jsx
const classFilterOptions = [
  { value: 'All', label: 'All Classes' },
  { value: 'Favorited', label: 'Favorited' },
  { value: 'Pending', label: 'Pending' },
  { value: 'YourNew', label: 'Your New Filter' }, // Add here
];
```

Then update filter logic in the page component.

### Add More Data:
Edit `classManagementApp.jsx`:
```jsx
const mockClasses = [
  // Add more objects here
  { id: 8, grade: 'Grade 7', section: 'Section A', ... }
];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Icons not showing
**Solution:** Make sure lucide-react is installed:
```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

### Issue: Page looks broken
**Solution:** Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured and running

### Issue: Navigation not working
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Ensure all imports are correct.

### Issue: Search/filter not working
**Solution:** Type in console: Check if state updates are happening
